📘 Business Process Automation – Internal Nokia Project

![Nokia Logo](images/nokia_logo.png)

This project involves the development of an internal reporting and automation application for Nokia, built entirely on the Microsoft Power Platform. The solution replaces a previously complex and error-prone manual process with a fully digital workflow — increasing efficiency, consistency, and traceability across the organization.

🔧 Technologies Used

- Microsoft Power Apps – user interface for creating and managing service/product reports

- Power Automate – automation of approval, scheduling, and notification workflows

- Microsoft Lists (SharePoint) – structured data storage with controlled access

- Microsoft 365 Integration – seamless connection with Outlook, Teams, and internal user accounts

- Excel / SharePoint environment – backend data management and synchronization

- Power BI (planned) – advanced analytics and performance dashboards

📊 Key Features & Functionality

- Designed and implemented a complete data model (two related tables, 1:N relationship) ensuring data integrity and logical consistency

- Created custom validation rules and field-level logic before data submission to maintain data accuracy

- Developed automatic generation of custom IDs for relational data tracking

- Implemented access management for specific users, including request and approval workflows

- Added automated meeting scheduling – depending on user selections in a request, the system automatically identifies the right recipients (e.g. domain_1, domain_3) and sends standardized meeting invites and notifications

- Designed the entire UI/UX from scratch, ensuring intuitive navigation and a modern, user-friendly experience

- Fully integrated with Microsoft 365 security and compliance standards, ensuring data protection within the corporate environment

🚀 Current Status

The current version is a fully functional prototype, with the reporting process already fully operational and automated. The system currently streamlines product/service reporting and scheduling, significantly reducing manual workload and improving accuracy and transparency.
At this stage, work is ongoing to fully automate the message-sending process, which will further enhance communication efficiency and eliminate the need for manual notifications.
The next phase will include the implementation of Power BI dashboards for analytics, performance tracking, and continuous process improvement.

💡 Project Impact

This initiative demonstrates the potential of Microsoft Power Platform in automating internal corporate processes. It showcases practical experience with Power Apps, Power Automate, and SharePoint, as well as a deep understanding of data modeling, user access control, and workflow optimization in an enterprise environment.
